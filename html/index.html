      <p>
        At the end of the 1960s, rock'n'roll, like music in general, came to be
        confronted with something new, unusual, and which would be responsible for
        the creation of a musical universe totally different from the existing
        ones. The responsible for this feat is Pink Floyd, one of the main bands
        on the planet. Psychedelia, experimentalism and mega-shows are hallmarks
        of this band, which transformed the way of "making" rock and marked a new
        era in music, with progressive rock.
      </p>
      <p>
        The history of Pink Floyd began in 1965. Rick Wright, Roger Waters and
        Nick Mason studied architecture at Cambridge University in London, and
        decided to form a band and venture into small shows in London pubs. The
        trio was named Sigma 6 and their initial repertoire featured blues and
        folk covers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shortly after, they decide to increase the contingent of members and
        Waters introduces two friends from college, Roger Keith (Syd Barret) and
        David Gilmour. With a new group formed, the musicians decide to change the
        band's name to The Screaming Abdabds, Barret's guess. There were other
        names like Abdabs and T-Set, before they arrived at Pink Floyd, which is
        nothing more than the combination of the names of two bluesmen, Pink
        Anderson and Floyd Council, of whom Syd Barret was a fan.
      </p>
      <p>
        David Gilmour decides to leave the group and go to France, establishing
        from there the following Pink Floyd formation: Roger Waters on bass and
        vocals, Syd Barret on guitar and vocals, Rick Wright, keyboard and vocals
        and Nick Manson on drums . The group was performing at small festivals
        that took place in London.
      </p>
      <p>
        The great thing about Pink Floyd was the use of slides in her
        presentations. During the show, several slides were projected over the
        entire stage, a totally innovative initiative that would be adopted by
        several other bands later. Syd Barret, who besides being a musician was
        also painter, was one of the main responsible for the project. The
        foursome started to gain greater visibility in the London music scene and
        soon were invited to record some singles, which were broadcast on the
        radio. But the great opportunity came with the hiring of the band by the
        record company EMI, who took them to record at the magical Abbey Road
        studio.
      </p>
      <p>
        The band had a huge challenge ahead of them. Enter a music scene that had
        names like Beatles, Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, among others.
        It would not be an easy task. In this same period and in the same studio
        in which Pink Floyd recorded their first album, the Beatles recorded Sgt.
        Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967). Being face to face with the
        Beatles may have helped Floyd a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then in 1967 The Piper at the Gates of Down was released, which
        immediately ranks at the top of the English charts. This work is
        considered by many to be the starting point of progressive rock and rivals
        Sgt. Peppers ... the title of the first work of rock art.
      </p>
      <p>
        The band was already enjoying success, but not everything was happiness.
        Barrett's mental health was impaired due to the excessive use of drugs,
        reaching the limit of, in one of the performances, the musician being able
        to play only one chord. No longer able to play, Barret was gradually
        removed from the group; an unfortunate situation since he was one of the
        most creative musicians in the band. During this period, David Gilmour
        returned from France and was invited to join Pink Floyd again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Roger Waters begins to assume the leadership of the band and soon leaves
        the second album, A Saucerful of Secrets (1968). The work is very well
        accepted and ends up proving that the group can move on without Barret.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1969, they composed More, the soundtrack of the homonymous film
        (directed by Barbet Schroeder). Still in 69, they released Ummagumma, a
        double album, one recorded in the studio and the other live. The 70s start
        with Atom Heart Mother, which has a very curious cover about the title,
        showing a photo of a cow. Parallel to this, Gilmour and Waters tried to
        help their friend Syd, producing the albums The Madcap Laughs and Barrets,
        both of 1970. However, Syd was unable to rehabilitate himself and his
        musical career came to an end. After that, he isolates himself and starts
        to dedicate himself only to painting.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1971 Meddle is released and the following year Obscured By Clouds,
        track by film La Vall√©e (1972, again under the direction of Barbet
        Schroeder). Following the cinematographic line, Live at Pompeii (1972,
        with directed by Adrian Maben), documentary of the group's anthological
        show in ruins of Pompeii, Italy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite several projects and releases, the peak of Pink Floyd would happen
        in 1973, with Dark Side of the Moon. It is a masterpiece without precedent
        in history, which broke and created several records. He stayed on the
        American charts for more than 14 years, he was among the 50 best selling
        albums in England for more than two years and among the 100 for more than
        eight. A curiosity: EMI, the band's record company, even built factories
        for the exclusive production of Dark Side of the Moon, the demand was so
        great. The album was handled by the respected sound engineer Alan Parson,
        who played a key role in the production of this symbolic work. Songs like
        'Time' and 'Money' demonstrate the quality of the record.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next job would not be very well accepted in the beginning, due to the
        strong criticisms to the entertainment industry. However, after a while,
        the album received the recognition it deserved, being considered one of
        the best of Pink Floyd. Wish You Were Here (1975) is a kind of tribute to
        Syd Barret, who is said to have appeared dirty, bald and wearing rags, in
        the studio where the band recorded. Due to the state of the former Pink
        Floyd member, his colleagues found it difficult to recognize him and felt
        touched by the situation. The track 'Wish You Were Here', nowadays, one of
        the most famous of the band, ended up giving the title to the album, which
        paid homage to the troubled Barret.
      </p>
      <p>
        Animals (1977) was a work based on the book The Animal Revolution, by
        George Orwell, which makes a severe critique of the capitalist system.
        This album accentuates the band's stage of protest and psychedelia. At the
        same time as the Animals tour, members of the group were working on side
        projects. David Gilmour released a self-titled album and Rick Wright
        released Wet Dream, both from 1978. At the time, Roger Waters was
        especially devoted to Pink and established himself as the band's leader.
      </p>
      <p>
        After Dark Side ... and Wish You Were Here, it would be hard to imagine
        that Pink Floyd producing a better or as good job as the previous two. But
        in 1979, The Wall was launched, a highly emblematic work that criticized
        the education system in England, in addition to portraying human
        weaknesses. The album's success was devastating. The production of the
        tour was one of the most expensive and grandiose in the history of music.
        The work was classified as a rock opera, like Tommy (1969), from The Who,
        and became a film of the same name in 1982, directed by Alan Parker. Like
        the album, the film was a huge success and was also considered a
        masterpiece. Roger Waters was considered the main responsible for this
        phase of Pink Floyd and his relationship with the rest of the band was not
        very good.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Final Cut (1983) is more an individual work by Waters than Pink Floyd.
        The whole idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe album and the compositions are his own. Rick
        Wright was removed from the group by Waters and the relationship problems
        between him and his colleagues worsened. In 1985 he decided to leave Pink
        Floyd, leaving David Gilmour as the new leader.
      </p>
      <p>
        From there, a legal battle between Gilmour and Waters is fought over the
        possession of the name Pink Floyd, with Gilmour being the winner. Wright
        is brought back to the group and soon they release A Momentary Lapse of
        Reason (1987), considered one of Floyd's weakest works. Waters begins his
        solo career and launches Radio K.A.O.S and When the Wind Blows, both from
        1978.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last record recorded by Pink Floyd was The Division Bell (1994).
        Before that, in 88, the live album Delicate Sound of Thunder was released.
        In 1995 Pulse came out, also live. After this work, several compilations
        were released, being: Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd (2001), the best
        known.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the late 90s and early 2000s, Roger kept on tour, playing songs
        from his solo career and Pink Floyd classics, in shows highly praised by
        critics and audiences. He even performed here in Brazil, in 2002, in the
        cities of Porto Alegre, Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo. David Gilmour did
        not stand still either. In 2001 he recorded an acoustic at the Royal
        Albert Hall festival (which has no connection with acoustic acquaintances
        promoted by MTV) and which featured the participation of Rick Wright, a
        former friend of Pink Floyd. And to everyone's surprise, in July of this
        year Pink Floyd, whose members had been separated for more than 20 years,
        got together for a presentation at Live Aid 8 "‚Äù an event held to fight
        hunger on the African continent.
      </p>
      <p>
        You don't have to look far to see the marks left by Pink Floyd on the
        music scene. From mega-productions to inventive CD covers, the band exudes
        art from all sides. The complexity, excellence, precision and creativity
        of the members of Floyd, whether in the process of composition or in the
        production of the shows, established innovative musical techniques and
        patterns, which broke with any other established paradigm and are used by
        several bands today. Pink Floyd is music, it's history, and it's art. The
        best.
      </p>
      <p>
        In an interview with the Italian newspaper La Repubblica on February 3,
        2006, Gilmour indicated the end of Pink Floyd, declaring that the
        celebrated group will not produce any new material, nor will it meet
        again. However, the possibility of making a presentation similar to Live 8
        was not ruled out either by Gilmour or Mason.
      </p>
      <p>
        Waters was invited to join him in London, but the last rehearsals for his
        2006 tour made him refuse. Mason joined Waters on June 29, 2006 in the
        second half of the show in Cork, Ireland, where he played the entire Dark
        Side of the Moon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Waters and Wright both worked on solo albums, and it is rumored that
        Waters would be making a Broadway musical version of The Wall, with extra
        songs written by him. Waters also embarked on his world tour "The Dark
        Side of the Moon Live Tour", and the repertoire consisted of the entire
        Dark Side of the Moon, along with a few selections of Pink Floyd songs and
        a few solo songs from Waters' career. Waters also contributed the song
        "Hello (I Love You)", co-written by Howard Shore, for the 2007 film, "The
        Key of the Universe" (The Last Minzy). Waters had his opera "√áa Ira"
        performed in Brazil during the 12th Manaus Opera Festival, with
        performances on the 15th, 22nd and 24th of April 2008. During the show on
        the 15th, Waters was present.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pink Floyd keyboardist and founding member Richard Wright died Monday,
        September 15, 2008, aged 65 after a short battle with cancer, as his
        adviser announced.
